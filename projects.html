                    <h3>The NASA X-57 Maxwell</h3>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> GRC Systems Lead</p>
                    <p>Led the Glenn Research Center's systems analysis for NASA's first all-electric experimental aircraft in two decades. My responsibilities included performance and thermal design for the battery, motor, and power systems. I also led the design and fabrication of several high-performance electric motors and their innovative cooling systems. This project was a critical step in proving the viability of distributed electric propulsion.</p>

                    <h3>Adaptive Cooling for Electric Propulsion</h3>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Principal Investigator (PI)</p>
                    <p>Conceived and led a 5-person team on an Independent R&D award to develop a passive, shape-memory alloy adaptive cooling system. This novel technology was designed to offer a high-reliability, low-weight solution to one of the key challenges in electric propulsion: thermal management.</p>

                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Co-PI & Avionics Lead</p>
                    <p>As part of an 11-person team, I developed and flew a high-altitude balloon project to test autonomous navigation and landing technologies. This system was designed to significantly improve the recovery rates of multi-million dollar scientific payloads and has since spawned a commercial variant for military applications.</p>

                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Founder & Manager</p>
                    <p>Identified the need for a collaborative, hands-on space for rapid prototyping and founded the Innovation Lab and Makerspace at NASA Glenn. I grew the community to over 100 members, equipping them with the tools and environment to bring their innovative ideas to life.</p>
